# Data Mining
  
Data mining deals with the fetching of meaningful information (non-trivial, unknown, hidden, and implicit) or knowledge for huge amounts of data, which helps visualize and analyse the data for various commercial and scientific purposes.  
This process takes place after the data warehousing process, as it requires compiled or appropriate data to extract useful information.
