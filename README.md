# Data Mining  
  
Data mining deals with the fetching of meaningful information (non-trivial, unknown, hidden, and implicit) or knowledge for huge amounts of data, which helps visualize and analyse the data for various commercial and scientific purposes.  
  
This process takes place after the data warehousing process, as it requires compiled or appropriate data to extract useful information.   
  
# Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)
  
  
* <b>Data Cleaning</b>: Data cleaning step eliminates the inconsistencies and aberrations from the data. It standardizes and makes the data useable. Removal of noise or outliers. Collecting necessary information to model or account for noise.  
Strategies for handling missing data fields.  
  
*	<b>Data Integration</b>: This step of KDD is used to integrate or collaborate various databases of different types. The databases from various sources are integrated into a single database i.e. the different formats of data are standardized to a single form.  
  
*	<b>Data Selection and Transformation</b>: Finding useful features to represent the data depending on the goal of the task. Using dimensionality reduction or transformation methods to reduce the effective number of variables under consideration or to find invariant representations for the data.  
  
*	<b>Data Mining</b>: Searching for patterns of interest in a particular representational form or a set of such representations as classification rules or trees, regression, clustering, and so forth. Selecting method(s) to be used for searching for patterns in the data.  
  
*	<b>Pattern Evaluation</b> : The obtained patterns are then evaluated and analysed for interesting information and then stored in the database as given to user in the form of knowledge.
